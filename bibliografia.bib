   abstract = {Although older age is the greatest risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), OA is not an inevitable consequence of growing old. Radiographic changes of OA, particularly osteophytes, are common in the aged population, but symptoms of joint pain may be independent of radiographic severity in many older adults. Ageing changes in the musculoskeletal system increase the propensity to OA but the joints affected and the severity of disease are most closely related to other OA risk factors such as joint injury, obesity, genetics and anatomical factors that affect joint mechanics. The ageing changes in joint tissues that contribute to the development of OA include cell senescence that results in development of the senescent secretory phenotype and ageing changes in the matrix including formation of advanced glycation end-products that affect the mechanical properties of joint tissues. An improved mechanistic understanding of joint ageing will likely reveal new therapeutic targets to slow or halt disease progression. The ability to slow progression of OA in older adults will have enormous public health implications given the ageing of our population and the increase in other OA risk factors such as obesity. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Many risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA) have been noted, while gender/sex differences have been understated. The work aimed to systematically review literature investigating as primary aim the relationship between gender/sex related discriminants and OA. The search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Knowledge in the last 10 years. Inclusion criteria were limited to clinical studies of patients affected by OA in any joints, analyzing as primary aim gender/sex differences. Exclusion criteria were review articles, in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo studies, case series studies and papers in which gender/sex differences were adjusted as confounding variable. Of the 120 records screened, 42 studies were included. Different clinical outcomes were analyzed: morphometric differences, followed by kinematics, pain, functional outcomes after arthroplasty and health care needs of patients. Women appear to use more health care, have higher OA prevalence, clinical pain and inflammation, decreased cartilage volume, physical difficulty, and smaller joint parameters and dimensions, as compared to men. No in-depth studies or mechanistic studies analyzing biomarker differential expressions, molecular pathways and omic profiles were found that might drive preclinical and clinical research towards sex-/gender-oriented protocols.},

  abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous disorder. The goals of this review are (1) To stimulate use of standardized nomenclature for OA that could serve as building blocks for describing OA and defining OA phenotypes, in short to provide unifying disease concepts for a heterogeneous disorder; and (2) To stimulate establishment of ROAD (Risk of OA Development) and ROAP (Risk of OA Progression) tools analogous to the FRAX™ instrument for predicting risk of fracture in osteoporosis; and (3) To stimulate formulation of tools for identifying disease in its early preradiographic and/or molecular stages - REDI (Reliable Early Disease Identification). Consensus around more sensitive and specific diagnostic criteria for OA could spur development of disease modifying therapies for this entity that has proved so recalcitrant to date. We fully acknowledge that as we move forward, we expect to develop more sophisticated definitions, terminology and tools.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Background: High body mass index, as well as maintaining this condition for a long period of time, are important risk factors for the development of osteoarthritis. Aim: To determine joint pain and osteoarthritis prevalence in patients referred to bariatric surgery. Methods: Morbidly obese patients referred to bariatric surgery responded to the visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and the WOMAC questionnaire. X-rays of the hips and knees were evaluated. The primary endpoints were self-reported joint pain and the diagnosis of osteoarthritis by clinical and radiological criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Results: 141 patients were interviewed (85.1% women) with a mean age of 40 years. The mean body mass index was 46. The lumbar spine and knee joint were the most commonly reported as painful (77.9% and 73.2% respectively). Prevalence of knee osteoarthritis was 63.1% and hip osteoarthritis was 40.8%. Age, mean VAS and WOMAC scores were higher in the osteoarthritic individuals. Conclusion: There is prevalence of 90.1% of pain symptoms in morbidly obese patients referred to bariatric surgery. The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis was 63.1% and hip osteoarthritis was 40.8% in this sample.},

@article{Spector2004,
   abstract = {Although the multifactorial nature of osteoarthritis (OA) is well recognized, genetic factors have been found to be strong determinants of the disease. Evidence of a genetic influence of OA comes from a number of sources, including epidemiological studies of family history and family clustering, twin studies, and exploration of rare genetic disorders. Classic twin studies have shown that the influence of genetic factors is between 39% and 65% in radiographic OA of the hand and knee in women, about 60% in OA of the hip, and about 70% in OA of the spine. Taken together, these estimates suggest a heritability of OA of 50% or more, indicating that half the variation in susceptibility to disease in the population is explained by genetic factors. Studies have implicated linkages to OA on chromosomes 2q, 9q, 11q, and 16p, among others. Genes implicated in association studies include VDR, AGC1, IGF-1, ER alpha, TGF beta, CRTM (cartilage matrix protein), CRTL (cartilage link protein), and collagen II, IX, and XI. Genes may operate differently in the two sexes, at different body sites, and on different disease features within body sites. OA is a complex disease, and understanding its complexity should help us find the genes and new pathways and drug targets. © 2003 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.

   abstract = {Objective: The objective was to determine whether knee osteoarthritis (OA) reduces exercise ambulatory capacity and impairs quality of life (QOL) in obese individuals. Research Methods and Procedures: There were 56 subjects, with and without knee OA, who were obese. The subjects were evaluated with anthropometric measurements, a body composition assessment, maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), perceived exertion (RPE), self-reported disability [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)], and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36). Results: VO 2peak was significantly higher in the controls when compared with the patients (mean ±standard deviation, 1.584 ± 0.23 L/kg per min vs. 0.986 ± 0.20 L/kg per min; p < 0.001). Obese subjects without knee OA walked a significantly longer distance in the 6-MWT than obese patients with knee OA (p < 0.001). We also observed significant negative correlation between VO2max and RPE, WOMAC pain and physical limitation, and bodily pain and general health domains of short-form 36. Discussion: Knee OA reduces exercise and ambulatory capacity and impairs QOL in obese individuals. RPE, WOMAC pain, and SF-36 items might provide information about exercise capacity in the obese subjects with knee OA. Our study confirms that exercise capacity and QOL might be improved by energetic and intensive treatment of pain resulting from knee OA. Copyright © 2007 NAASO.},

              This "Year in Review" presents a curated selection of research themes and individual studies within the clinical osteoarthritis (OA) field, focusing on epidemiology and therapy. The search was conducted in electronic database MEDLINE from March 4, 2023, to March 31, 2024, specifically targeting English-language articles involving human participants. Inclusions were based on perceived importance and relevance to identifying risk factors or advancing OA treatments. A total of 6539 studies were screened by the 5 authors, resulting in 157 studies considered for potential inclusion. Ultimately, 44 studies were selected, uncovering six key OA-related themes: i) the burden of OA (mostly from Global Burden of Disease studies), ii) pain drivers and trajectories, iii) impacts of sex/gender, iv) OA risk factors, and treatments for v) hand and vi) knee OA. The prevalence of OA continues to rise, particularly affecting women, with unclear distinctions in risk factors and treatment responses between sexes. Associations with atopy were demonstrated in two significant databases. Notably, the authors were particularly interested in recent high-quality methodology randomized controlled trials focusing on hand (methotrexate, denosumab, colchicine, topical betamethasone) and knee OA with conflicting results about stem cell injection. These findings collectively contribute to show the growing burden of OA, but also to help the understanding of OA pathophysiology and inform ongoing efforts to enhance management for people with OA.}

   abstract = {As the cellular component of articular cartilage, chondrocytes are responsible for maintaining in a low-turnover state the unique composition and organization of the matrix that was determined during embryonic and postnatal development. In joint diseases, cartilage homeostasis is disrupted by mechanisms that are driven by combinations of biological mediators that vary according to the disease process, including contributions from other joint tissues. In osteoarthritis (OA), biomechanical stimuli predominate with up-regulation of both catabolic and anabolic cytokines and recapitulation of developmental phenotypes, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammation and catabolism drive cartilage loss. In vitro studies in chondrocytes have elucidated signaling pathways and transcription factors that orchestrate specific functions that promote cartilage damage in both OA and RA. Thus, understanding how the adult articular chondrocyte functions within its unique environment will aid in the development of rational strategies to protect cartilage from damage resulting from joint disease. This review will cover current knowledge about the specific cellular and biochemical mechanisms that regulate cartilage homeostasis and pathology. © 2009 BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Objective: To quantify inflammatory changes in synovial membranes from orthopaedic "non-inflammatory" arthropathies (Orth. A). Methods: Synovial membranes from patients with femur fracture, avascular necrosis of the femur, plica syndrome, and meniscus and/or ligament injury (n = 23); rheumatoid arthritis (n = 28); osteoarthritis (OA; n = 25); and from normal controls (n = 10) were assessed by light microscopy, a histological synovitis score, immunostaining for CD3, CD20, CD38, CD68, Ki-67 and von Willebrand factor, and with an immunohistochemical inflammation score. Results: Orth. A histology varied between normal and markedly inflamed. Predominant abnormalities were mild lining hyperplasia, scattered inflammatory cells and small perivascular infiltrates. The synovitis score classified Orth. A as "mild synovitis". Inflammatory cells occurred frequently: CD68+ cells in 100% of Orth. A specimens; CD3+, 91%; CD38+, 70%; and CD20+, 39%. Orth. A had 36% greater lining thickness (p = 0.04), 40% higher vascular density (p = 0.009) and 51.3-fold higher CD38+ cell density (p = 0.02) than normal controls; and 60% fewer subintimal Ki-67+ cells (p = 0.003), 42% fewer CD68+ lining cells (p<0.01) and 40% fewer subintimal CD68+ cells (p<0.01) than OA. The immunohistochemical inflammation score was 2.2-fold higher in Orth. A than in controls (p = 0.048) and similar to OA, with three Orth. A specimens showing marked inflammation. Conclusions: Synovial membranes from "non- inflammatory" arthropathies featured neovascularisation and inflammation intermediate between normal and OA synovium. These results expand previous findings that mechanical joint injury may lead to a mild-to-moderate synovitis.},

Para isso foram recrutados 20 pacientes com osteoartrite do joelho uni ou bilateral, que foram distribuídos em dois grupos: grupo-controle (GC), que realizou aplicação de fotobiomodulação (FBM) placebo e um protocolo de exercício; e grupo fotobiomodulação (GF), que realizou aplicação ativa da FBM e o protocolo de exercício, sendo esse realizado duas vezes por semana durante oito semanas e consistindo de alongamentos passivos dos músculos de membros inferiores, straight leg raise, treinamento proprioceptivo e exercícios para o controle da marcha. A FBM foi aplicada com o aparelho cluster contendo quatro diodos de 670 nm e cinco diodos de 850 nm, com uma potência de saída de 540 mW, sendo a dose utilizada de 4 J/cm2.

Twenty patients with unilateral or bilateral knee osteoarthritis were selected and divided into two groups: Control group (CG), which underwent photobiomodulation (PBM) placebo and exercise protocol; and the photobiomodulation group (PG), which performed an active application of the PBM and the exercise protocol - performed twice a week for eight weeks and consisting of passive stretching of the lower extremity muscles, straight leg raise, proprioceptive training and exercises for gait control. PBM was applied through a cluster apparatus containing four diodes of 670 nm and five diodes of 850 nm, with an output power of 540 mW and with a dose of 4J / cm2. The groups were evaluated before and after treatment with the SF-36, Lequesne and Tinetti questionnaires as well as the Visual Analog Pain Scale. Data were analyzed using the Anova method, followed by the post-hoc Bonferroni test. The data indicated significant improvements in the PG at the end of treatment for Visual Analog Pain Scale (2±1.25 vs. 0.7±0.82, p=0.009). Although both groups achieved significant improvements throughout the treatment, we could not observe significant differences between them for the rest of the evaluations at the end of the treatment. Therefore, the use of PBM associated with exercises showed pain improvement in patients with knee osteoarthritis, although it was not possible to observe significant differences in patients’ functionality.RESUMEN El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar el efecto de la fotobiomodulación asociada a ejercicios sobre el dolor y la funcionalidad de pacientes con osteoartritis de rodilla.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and functional efficacy of 2 different non-weight-bearing exercise regimens, proprioceptive training (PrT) versus strength training (ST), for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). BACKGROUND: Both strength and proprioceptive training are important interventions for individuals with knee OA. The benefits of weight-bearing exercises are generally recognized in the clinical setting. However, exercising in a standing or weight-bearing position may aggravate symptoms in patients with knee OA. METHODS AND MEASURES: One hundred eight patients were randomly assigned to the PrT, ST, or no exercise (control) group for an 8-week intervention. Both the PrT and ST interventions consisted of non-weight-bearing exercises. Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index-pain (WOMAC-pain) and -function scores, walking time on 3 different terrains, knee strength, and absolute knee reposition error were assessed before and after intervention. Data were analyzed using mixed-model ANOVAs. RESULTS: Both PrT and ST significantly improved WOMAC-pain and -function score after intervention (P<.008). The improvement secondary to ST in the WOMAC-function scores (17.2 points) and for knee extension strength (10.3-14.9 Nm) was greater than the minimally clinically important difference for these measurements. The PrT group demonstrated greater improvement in walking time on a spongy surface and knee reposition error than the other 2 groups. No improvements were apparent in the control group. CONCLUSION: Both types of non-weight-bearing exercises (PrT and ST) significantly improved outcomes in this study. PrT led to greater improvements in proprioceptive function, while ST resulted in a greater increase in knee extensor muscle strength.},

  abstract = {INTRODUÇÃO: a osteoartrite do joelho (OA) é uma doença articular degenerativa, que ocasiona desgaste e perda progressiva da cartilagem local. Os sintomas de OA incluem rigidez, mobilidade articular limitada e presença de dor que podem levar a uma diminuição na qualidade de vida e comprometimento da saúde. A interpretação/análise clínica de imagens suporta um trabalho cada vez maior nos centros ortopédicos e de radiologia. O presente estudo desenvolveu e aplicou o desempenho de uma rede neural convolucional projetada para auxiliar ortopedistas e radiologistas na detecção e classificação de osteoartrite do joelho de graus iniciais a severos, de acordo com o sistema de classificação Kellgren-Lawrence (KL). OBJETIVO: Desenvolver e validar uma CNN capaz de classificar e diagnosticar a OA no joelho de forma dinâmica e eficaz. Material e métodos: Utilizou-se uma pesquisa descritiva de caráter quali quantitativo e métodos da IA aplicados na análise do movimento humano. Foi utilizado um banco de dados com radiografias de OA de joelho (Grau 0 - 3.085 imagens, Grau 1 - 1.416 imagens, Grau 2 - 2.062 imagens, Grau 3 - 1.029 imagens e Grau 4 - 236 imagens). Para análise e classificação das imagens foi utilizado um ambiente de desenvolvimento da linguagem Python, por meio da aplicação Google Colab executada via browser. As imagens foram utilizadas para treinar um conjunto de arquiteturas de rede neural para a previsão do nível de gravidade, segundo a classificação de KL em OA. RESULTADOS: em seguida da configuração da CNN, iniciou-se o treinamento de máquina com as radiografias, em seguida realizados testes e por fim a integração, obtendo-se uma classificação expressa com as de taxas de sensibilidade de teste com a densidade de rede com joelho saudável, OA leve, moderado e grave. Após a classificação e análise das imagens na rede convolucional, foi gerado o comportamento do classificador sobre a precisão do algoritmo na exatidão do diagnóstico. O algoritmo apresentou acurácia de 0,85 (OA mínimo), 0,79 ( joelho saudável), 0,89 (OA moderado) e 0,98 (OA severo. Precisão de 0,67 (joelho saudável), 0,71 (OA mínimo), 0,86 (OA moderado) e 0,82 (OA severo). Sensibilidade de 0,65 (joelho saudável), 0,77 (OA mínimo), 0,79 (OA moderado) e 0,93 (OA severo). Especificidade de 0,86 (joelho saudável), 0,88 (OA mínimo), 0,94 (OA moderado) e 0,93 (OA severo). CONCLUSÃO: Nossos modelos de aprendizagem profunda propostos forneceram alta precisão e acurácia satisfatória para a detecção e classificação de osteoartrite leve ao severo do joelho em radiografias simples. Esses modelos podem ser usados como auxílio no diagnóstico clínico de radiografias de joelho e na orientação do tratamento em cada estágio da patologia para médicos, radiologistas e profissionais do movimento humano},

This requires the physician’s expertise, suitable experience, and a lot of time, and even after that the diagnosis can be prone to errors. Therefore, researchers in the ML/DL domain have employed the capabilities of deep neural network (DNN) models to identify and classify KOA images in an automated, faster, and accurate manner. To this end, we propose the application of six pretrained DNN models, namely, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet121 for KOA diagnosis using images obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset. More specifically, we perform two types of classification, namely, a binary classification, which detects the presence or absence of KOA and secondly, classifying the severity of KOA in a three-class classification. For a comparative analysis, we experiment on three datasets (Dataset I, Dataset II, and Dataset III) with five, two, and three classes of KOA images, respectively. We achieved maximum classification accuracies of 69%, 83%, and 89%, respectively, with the ResNet101 DNN model. Our results show an improved performance from the existing work in the literature.},

   abstract = {Objectives. Joint pain comorbidity (JPC) is common in individuals with knee OA. This study investigates the longitudinal association between JPC and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and physical activity levels in individuals with knee OA. Methods: Data from the progression cohort of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (n = 1233; age 61 years and 58% females) were analysed. JPC was considered present if individuals reported pain in three or more joint groups, including the knee joints. HRQoL was assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Quality of Life subscale, and self-reported physical activity was determined using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses were performed, adjusted for age, sex, duration of complaints, medical comorbidity, and physical and mental functioning. Results: Over the 4-year period, 32% of participants never reported JPC, whereas 12% always reported JPC. GEE modelling demonstrated that having JPC was negatively associated with HRQoL [regression coefficient β (95% CI) -3.57 (-4.69, -2.44)] and not associated with physical activity [-1.32 (-6.61, 3.98)]. Conclusion: Considering the impact of JPC on the HRQoL of individuals with knee OA, the assessment of JPC in individuals with knee OA might be a daily routine. © The Author 2012.

Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word "reinforcement." The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

   abstract = {Background. Recent evidences show that education and rehabilitation while waiting for knee replacement have positive effects on the patients' health status. Identification of factors associated with worse pain, function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) while waiting for surgery could help develop pre-surgery rehabilitation interventions that target specifically these factors and prioritize patients that may benefit the most from them. The objectives of this study were to measure pain, stiffness, function and HRQoL in patients at enrolment on waiting lists for knee replacement and to identify demographic, clinical, socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics associated with these outcomes. Methods. This study is part of a broader study measuring the effects of pre-surgery wait in patients scheduled for knee replacement. From 02/2006 to 09/2007, 197 patients newly scheduled for total knee replacement were recruited from the waiting lists of three university hospitals in Quebec City, Canada. Pain, stiffness and function were measured with the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and HRQoL was measured with the SF-36 Health Survey. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to assess the strength of the associations between the independent variables and the WOMAC and SF-36 scores. Results. The scores of all eight HRQoL physical and mental domains of the SF-36 were significantly lower than aged matched Canadian normative data (p < 0.05). Contralateral knee pain, higher psychological distress, higher body mass index (BMI) and the use of a walking aid were significantly associated with worse function (p < 0.05) and contributed to 22% of the variance of the WOMAC function score (multiple r = 0.47). A higher BMI, the use of a walking aid, contralateral knee pain and advanced age were significantly associated with worse physical function (p < 0.05) and contributed to 17% of the variance of the SF-36 HRQoL physical functioning score (multiple r = 0.41). Conclusion. Patients waiting for knee replacement have poor function and HRQoL. Characteristics that were found to be associated with these outcomes could help develop pre-surgery rehabilitation program and prioritize patients that may benefit the most from them. Such programs could include interventions to reduce psychological distress, therapeutic exercises targeting both knees and weight loss management. © 2009 Desmeules et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Because of the differences between rural and urban areas in terms of the provision of arthroplasty services and between the 2 patient groups, patient perspectives of waiting times may also be different. Methods: To compare waiting times for initial orthopedic consultation and total hip and knee arthroplasties in rural Ontario (Stratford) and in urban Ontario (London), and to compare patient perspectives of these waiting times, we mailed a survey to all 260 patients who underwent total hip or total knee arthroplasty between June 1, 2000, and June 1, 2001. The survey asked for the length of wait for consultation and for surgery, acceptability of waiting time for surgery, the effect of waiting on health and what an acceptable waiting time would be. Of the 260 surveys mailed 202 (78%) were returned. We reviewed the charts of the respondents to determine the actual waiting times. Results: The actual waiting times (mean [and standard deviation]) for initial consultation were significantly (p < 0.001) shorter in the rural (RUR) group (1.10 [0.53] mo) than the urban (URB) group (3.40 [1.34] mo). There was no significant difference in waiting times for surgery between RUR (8.45 [3.32] mo) and URB (9.32 [3.61] mo) groups. Surgical waiting times for both groups showed that 56% of all the patients had to wait longer than 9 months from the date surgery was recommended. Perceived waiting times for consultation were found to be 56.9% longer (p < 0.001) than the actual waiting times, but there was no significant difference between perceived and actual waiting times for surgery (p = 0.40). Fifty percent of the patients stated they were unhappy with the wait for surgery or found the wait unac-ceptable (56% of URB and 44% of RUR patients). There was no significant difference between RUR and URB in patients' acceptance of their wait for surgery (p = 0.09), but URB patients believed their wait for surgery made a greater contribution to health deterioration (p = 0.003). Thirty-eight percent of RUR and 54% of URB patients believed their surgical wait contributed to "a lot" or a "moderate" amount of deterioration in their health. Conclusions: Waiting times for hip or knee replacement surgery have increased to the point at which over 50% of surgical patients in 2000-2001 in RUR and URB orthopedic practices had waited longer than 9 months for surgery. In comparing these practices, there was a significantly longer wait in urban than rural practices for the initial consultation but no sig-nificant difference in waiting times for surgery. © 2005 CMA Media Inc.},

Health-related quality of life, physical activity, pain and function and the number of steps were assessed before, 3 and 6 months post-operatively. We used the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36), the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and the pedometer SW200 Digiwalker of Yamax.\n\nRESULTS: Patients showed a significant improvement (p< 0.01, η2 =0.22) in health-related quality of life, particularly in physical function, (p<0 .001) body pain (p< 0.001) and vitality scale (p< 0.001) of SF-36 at 3 and 6 months after the procedure. Physical activity (PASE score) increased at 3 and 6 months after arthroplasty (p< 0.001, η2 =0.74), and the number of steps increased 6 months after, compared to the assessment that took place 3 months after operation (p< 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that total knee arthroplasty leads to a gradual improvement in quality of life of elderly patients over the first 6 post-operative months.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved widespread success in medical image analysis, leading to an increasing demand for large-scale expert-annotated medical image datasets. Yet, the high cost of annotating medical images severely hampers the development of deep learning in this field. To reduce annotation costs, active learning aims to select the most informative samples for annotation and train high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. In this survey, we review the core methods of active learning, including the evaluation of informativeness and sampling strategy. For the first time, we provide a detailed summary of the integration of active learning with other label-efficient techniques, such as semi-supervised, self-supervised learning, and so on. We also summarize active learning works that are specifically tailored to medical image analysis. Additionally, we conduct a thorough comparative analysis of the performance of different AL methods in medical image analysis with experiments. In the end, we offer our perspectives on the future trends and challenges of active learning and its applications in medical image analysis.

The only way to control the progression of knee osteoarthritis is early detection. Currently, X-ray imaging is a central technique used for the prediction of osteoarthritis. However, the manual X-ray technique is prone to errors due to the lack of expertise of radiologists. Recent studies have described the use of automated systems based on machine learning for the effective prediction of osteoarthritis from X-ray images. However, most of these techniques still need to achieve higher predictive accuracy to detect osteoarthritis at an early stage. This paper suggests a method with higher predictive accuracy that can be employed in the real world for the early detection of knee osteoarthritis. In this paper, we suggest the use of transfer learning models based on sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), and Residual Neural Network 50 (ResNet-50) for the early detection of osteoarthritis from knee X-ray images. In our analysis, we found that all the suggested models achieved a higher level of predictive accuracy, greater than 90%, in detecting osteoarthritis. However, the best-performing model was the pretrained VGG-16 model, which achieved a training accuracy of 99% and a testing accuracy of 92%.},

Early diagnosis of OA in the knee joint is critical for effective treatment before facing severe irreversible pathology, and to develop new OA treatment techniques. Discussion on defining early OA has become more globally active. In this review, two proposals of the definition of early knee osteoarthritis, the Italian Rheumatology Association International and the First International Early OA Workshop proposed are introduced. These definitions of early OA have been proposed with a combination of “symptoms” of joint pain, “signs” such as joint stiffness, tenderness, or risk factors, and diagnostic imaging such as radiographs. Consensus on a more detailed classification and validation of the proposed definition of early OA are necessary to develop new treatment methods to suppress or prevent symptoms at an early stage before any progressive and irreversible change. Diagnostic imaging techniques such as MRI and ultrasound are superior compared to X-ray for visualization of soft tissues of joints and quantification of physical activity will become a key for the evaluation and development of new treatment strategies for early stages of osteoarthritis in the near future due to the fact that the structural and qualitative abnormalities of joints directly affect physical activity, and improvement of that will be the primary outcome of treatment for osteoarthritis in society.},

Current evidence based research data lead to reassessment of traditional approaches for treatment of patients with bone and joint disorders especially knee osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of the study was to review randomized clinical trials (RCT) and meta-analyses of RCT as well as recent guidelines of professional societies for application of arthroscopic lavage, debridement and meniscectomy in knee OA. Materials and Methods. Databases PubMed, e-LIBRARY, EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for the period from 2000 till 2019. From 138 heats irrelevant and poor quality studies were excluded. In total there were 1614 patients aged 48,9–62,8 in RCT and 20 770 patients aged 42–62,4 in meta-analyses of RCT. Results. Both arthroscopic lavage and debridement do not lead to significant pain relief as well as functional improvement in long term therefore are not recommended. Nonsurgical treatment should be the first line strategy in patients with early and moderate knee OA even with degenerative meniscal tears irrespective of mechanical symptoms like painful locking, catching or sudden giving way. Arthroscopy might be performed only if complex non-surgical treatment including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, structured exercises program and intra-articular injections failed after 3 months in patients without ‘bone on bone’ cartilage erosions and frontal malalignment or if the knee is mechanically locked due to bucked handle type meniscus tear or loose body. Conclusion. Evidence based medicine approach let us to conclude that arthroscopy in knee OA is non-efficient and rarely indicated therefore if proper non-surgical treatment is failed around the knee osteotomies and partial or total arthroplasty should be considered.},

Radiography is regarded as the gold standard and is the cheapest and most readily available modality. X-ray images are graded using Kellgren and Lawrence's (KL) grading scheme according to the order of severity of osteoarthritis from normal to severe. Early detection can help early treatment and hence slows down knee osteoarthritis degeneration. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches either merge or exclude perplexing grades to improve the performance of their models. This study aims to automatically detect and classify knee osteoarthritis according to the KL grading system for radiographs. We have proposed an automated deep learning-based ordinal classification approach for early diagnosis and grading knee osteoarthritis using a single posteroanterior standing knee x-ray image. An Osteoarthritis Initiative(OAI) based dataset of knee joint X-ray images is chosen for this study. The dataset was split into the training, testing, and validation set with a 7: 2: 1 ratio. We took advantage of transfer learning and fine-tuned ResNet-34, VGG-19, DenseNet 121, and DenseNet 161 and joined them in an ensemble to improve the model's overall performance. Our method has shown promising results by obtaining 98% overall accuracy and 0.99 Quadratic Weighted Kappa with a 95% confidence interval. Also, accuracy per KL grade is significantly improved. Furthermore, our methods outperform state-of-the-art automated methods.},

Capitalizing on these advances in computer vision, the medical imaging field has also witnessed growing interest for Transformers that can capture global context compared to CNNs with local receptive fields. Inspired from this transition, in this survey, we attempt to provide a comprehensive review of the applications of Transformers in medical imaging covering various aspects, ranging from recently proposed architectural designs to unsolved issues. Specifically, we survey the use of Transformers in medical image segmentation, detection, classification, restoration, synthesis, registration, clinical report generation, and other tasks.

  abstract  = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16–19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively.

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L2+1) direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet).

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization.

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer.},

On the other hand, CXR data with other findings are abundant. This situation is ideally suited for the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, where a lot of unlabeled data can be used through structural modeling by the self-attention mechanism. However, the use of existing ViT may not be optimal, as the feature embedding by direct patch flattening or ResNet backbone in the standard ViT is not intended for CXR. To address this problem, here we propose a novel Multi-task ViT that leverages low-level CXR feature corpus obtained from a backbone network that extracts common CXR findings. Specifically, the backbone network is first trained with large public datasets to detect common abnormal findings such as consolidation, opacity, edema, etc. Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpora for a versatile Transformer model for both the diagnosis and the severity quantification of COVID-19. We evaluate our model on various external test datasets from totally different institutions to evaluate the generalization capability. The experimental results confirm that our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both diagnosis and severity quantification tasks with outstanding generalization capability, which are sine qua non of widespread deployment.},

Recently, computer-aided methods are proposed to improve the efficiency of OA diagnosis. However, the human interventions required by previous semiautomatic segmentation methods limit the application on large-scale datasets. Moreover, well-known CNN architectures applied to the OA severity assessment do not explore the relations between different local regions. In this work, by integrating the object detection model, YOLO, with the visual transformer into the diagnosis procedure, we reduce human intervention and provide an end-to-end approach to automatic osteoarthritis diagnosis. Our approach correctly segments 95.57% of data at the expense of training on 200 annotated images on a large dataset that contains more than 4500 samples. Furthermore, our classification result improves the accuracy by 2.5% compared to the traditional CNN architectures.},

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs (e.g. VQA) or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine GradCAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on weakly-supervised localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we conduct human studies to measure if GradCAM explanations help users establish trust in predictions from deep networks and show that GradCAM helps untrained users successfully discern a "stronger" deep network from a "weaker" one.

Inclusions were based on perceived importance and relevance to identifying risk factors or advancing OA treatments. A total of 6539 studies were screened by the 5 authors, resulting in 157 studies considered for potential inclusion. Ultimately, 44 studies were selected, uncovering six key OA-related themes: (i) the burden of OA (mostly from Global Burden of Disease studies), (ii) pain drivers and trajectories, (iii) impacts of sex/gender, (iv) OA risk factors, and treatments for (v) hand and (vi) knee OA. The prevalence of OA continues to rise, particularly affecting women, with unclear distinctions in risk factors and treatment responses between sexes. Associations with atopy were demonstrated in two significant databases. Notably, the authors were particularly interested in recent high-quality methodology randomized controlled trials focusing on hand (methotrexate, denosumab, colchicine, topical betamethasone) and knee OA with conflicting results about stem cell injection. These findings collectively contribute to show the growing burden of OA, but also to help the understanding of OA pathophysiology and inform ongoing efforts to enhance management for people with OA.}

   abstract = {3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, 1, zidovudine, RetrovirTM) is used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. AZT, after conversion to AZT-5'-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by cellular enzymes, inhibits HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). The major clinical limitations of AZT are due to clinical toxicities that include bone marrow suppression, hepatic abnormalities and myopathy, absolute dependence on host cell kinase-mediated activation which leads to low activity, limited brain uptake, a short half-life of about one hour in plasma that dictates frequent administration to maintain therapeutic drug levels, low potential for metabolic activation and/or high susceptibility to catabolism, and the rapid development of resistance by HIV-1. These limitations have prompted the development of strategies for designing prodrugs of AZT. A variety of 5'-O-substituted prodrugs of AZT constitute the subject of this review. The drug-design rationale on which these approaches are based is that the ester conjugate will be converted by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic cleavage to AZT or its 5′-monophosphate (AZT-MP). Most prodrug derivatives of AZT have been prepared by derivatization of AZT at its 5'-O position to provide two prominent classes of compounds that encompass: A) 5'-O-carboxylic esters derived from 1) cyclic 5'-O-carboxylic acids such as steroidal 17b-carboxylic acids, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, bicyclam carboxylic acid derivatives, O-acetylsalicylic acid, and carbohydrate derivatives, 2) amino acids, 3) 1, 4-dihydro-1-methyl-3-pyridinylcarboxylic acid, 4) aliphatic fatty acid analogs such as myristic acid containing a heteroatom, or without a heteroatom such as stearic acid, and 5) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid analogs such as retinoic acid, and B) masked phosphates such as 1) phosphodiesters that include monoalkyl or monoaryl phosphate, carbohydrate, ether lipid, ester lipid, and foscarnet derivatives, 2) a variety of phosphotriesters that include dialkylphosphotriesters, diarylphosphotriesters, glycolate and lactate phosphotriesters, phosphotriester approaches using simultaneous enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis of bis(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters, bis(S-acyl-2-thioethyl) (SATE) esters, cyclosaligenyl prodrugs, glycosyl phosphotriesters, and steroidal phosphotriesters, 3) phosphoramidate derivatives, 4) dinucleoside phosphate derivatives that possess a second anti-HIV moiety such as AZT-P-ddA, AZT-P-ddI, AZTP2AZT, AZTP2ACV), and 5) 5'-hydrogen phosphonate and 5'-methylene phosphonate derivatives of AZT. In these prodrugs, the conjugating moiety is linked to AZT via a 5'-O-ester or 5'-O-phosphate group. 5'-O-Substituted AZT prodrugs have been designed with the objectives of improving anti-HIV activity, enhancing blood-brain barrier penetration, modifying pharmacokinetic properties to increase plasma half-life and improving drug delivery with respect to site-specific targeting or drug localization. Bypassing the first phosphorylation step, regulating transport and conferring sustained release of AZT prolong its duration of action, decrease toxicity and improve patient acceptability. The properties of these prodrugs and their anti-HIV activities are now reviewed.},

   abstract = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind. © 2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

@article{Bishop2007,
   abstract = {\{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh.

The distribution and administration of medications are about to change by using CV for medication management. This system scans pharmaceutical labels and keeps track of the process from delivery to administration using cameras, sensors, and computer algorithms. In order to assure accuracy in medicine delivery and dose, the system also makes it easier for doctors, nurses, and chemists to communicate. The computer vision-driven medication management system can significantly lower the number of medical mistakes that result from inaccurate or missing prescriptions, improper doses, or simply forgetting to take a particular drug. An exhaustive literature review has been done to identify work related to the research objectives. This paper is about CV and their need in healthcare. Various tasks associated with CV in the healthcare domain are discussed. Targeted healthcare goals through CV traits are briefed. Finally, the significant applications of CVs in healthcare were identified and discussed. Nowadays, CV has practical uses in healthcare. Its methods are widely used since they have shown excellent utility in several medical contexts, including medical imaging and surgical planning. The CV is used to study how to program computers to comprehend digital pictures. Numerous medical applications utilise this technology, such as automated abnormality identification, illness diagnosis, and surgical procedure guiding. CV is expanding quickly and has enormous promise to enhance healthcare. Some of the many CV applications in the healthcare sector include patient identification systems, medical picture analysis, surgical simulation and illness diagnosis.}

@article{Lohn2022,
   abstract = {We’re releasing an analysis showing that since 2012, the amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.5 month-doubling time (by comparison, Moore’s Law had an 18-month doubling period). Since 2012, this metric has grown by more than 300,000x (an 18-month doubling period would yield only a 12x increase). Improvements in compute have been a key component of AI progress, so as long as this trend continues, it’s worth preparing for the implications of systems far outside today’s capabilities. Overview Three factors drive the advance of AI: algorithmic innovation, data (which can be either supervised data or interactive environments), and the amount of compute available for training. Algorithmic innovation and data are difficult to track, but compute is unusually quantifiable, providing an opportunity to measure one input to AI progress. Of course, the use of massive compute sometimes just exposes the shortcomings of our current algorithms. But at least within many current domains, more compute seems to lead predictably to better performance, and is often complementary to algorithmic advances. For this analysis, we believe the relevant number is not the speed of a single GPU, nor the capacity of the biggest datacenter, but the amount of compute that is used to train a single model — this is the number most likely to correlate to how powerful our best models are. Compute per model differs greatly from total bulk compute because limits on parallelism (both hardware and algorithmic) have constrained how big a model can be or how much it can be usefully trained. Of course, important breakthroughs are still made with modest amounts of compute — this analysis just covers compute capability. The trend represents an increase by roughly a factor of 10 each year. It’s been partly driven by custom hardware that allows more operations to be performed per second for a given price (GPUs and TPUs), but it’s been primarily propelled by researchers repeatedly finding ways to use more chips in parallel and being willing to pay the economic cost of doing so.},

Results: Osteophytes can contribute both to the functional properties of affected joints and to clinical relevant symptoms. Osteophyte formation is highly associated with cartilage damage but osteophytes can develop without explicit cartilage damage. Osteophytes are mainly derived from precursor cells in the periosteum and growth factors of the TGFβ superfamily appear to play a crucial role in their induction.

However, the main goal of any neural network is to transform the non-linearly separable input data into more linearly separable abstract features using a hierarchy of layers. These layers are combinations of linear and nonlinear functions. The most popular and common non-linearity layers are activation functions (AFs), such as Logistic Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, ELU, Swish and Mish. In this paper, a comprehensive overview and survey is presented for AFs in neural networks for deep learning. Different classes of AFs such as Logistic Sigmoid and Tanh based, ReLU based, ELU based, and Learning based are covered. Several characteristics of AFs such as output range, monotonicity, and smoothness are also pointed out. A performance comparison is also performed among 18 state-of-the-art AFs with different networks on different types of data.

In the cortex, synapses are embedded within multilayered networks, making it difficult to determine the effect of an individual synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system. The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in deep artificial neural networks, but historically it has been viewed as biologically problematic. Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and the successes of artificial neural networks have reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation offers insights for understanding learning in the cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly by computing synaptic updates using feedback connections to deliver error signals. Although feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it is difficult to see how they could deliver the error signals required by strict formulations of backpropagation. Here we build on past and recent developments to argue that feedback connections may instead induce neural activities whose differences can be used to locally approximate these signals and hence drive effective learning in deep networks in the brain.},

But radiograph images have certain limitations, such as presence of too much noise and uneven contrast distribution across the image that impacts the accuracy and reliability of CAD systems. Therefore, a novel three-stage pre-processing method has been proposed using a combination of different techniques applied at sequential stages such as noise-reduction using gaussian-filter, normalization using pixel-centering method, and balanced contrast enhancement technique. A transfer-learning based VGG16 architecture has been used for severity classification. Our classification framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods achieving an excellent accuracy of 89.95\%.

To this end, there have been few works proposed to diagnose COVID-19 by using CXR-based methods. However, they have limited performance as they ignore the spatial relationships between the region of interests (ROIs) in CXR images, which could identify the likely regions of COVID-19’s effect in the human lungs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based deep learning model using the attention module with VGG-16. By using the attention module, we capture the spatial relationship between the ROIs in CXR images. In the meantime, by using an appropriate convolution layer (4th pooling layer) of the VGG-16 model in addition to the attention module, we design a novel deep learning model to perform fine-tuning in the classification process. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct extensive experiments by using three COVID-19 CXR image datasets. The experiment and analysis demonstrate the stable and promising performance of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The promising classification performance of our proposed method indicates that it is suitable for CXR image classification in COVID-19 diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Background: The methods for assessing knee osteoarthritis (OA) do not provide enough comprehensive information to make robust and accurate outcome predictions. Purpose: To develop a deep learning (DL) prediction model for risk of OA progression by using knee radiographs in patients who underwent total knee replacement (TKR) and matched control patients who did not undergo TKR. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective analysis that used data from the OA Initiative, a DL model on knee radiographs was developed to predict both the likelihood of a patient undergoing TKR within 9 years and Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade. Study participants included a case-control matched subcohort between 45 and 79 years. Patients were matched to control patients according to age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index. The proposed model used a transfer learning approach based on the ResNet34 architecture with sevenfold nested cross-validation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and conditional logistic regression assessed model performance for predicting probability and risk of TKR compared with clinical observations and two binary outcome prediction models on the basis of radiographic readings: KL grade and OA Research Society International (OARSI) grade. Results: Evaluated were 728 participants including 324 patients (mean age, 64 years 6 8 [standard deviation]; 222 women) and 324 control patients (mean age, 64 years 6 8; 222 women). The prediction model based on DL achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85, 0.90), outperforming a baseline prediction model by using KL grade with an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.77; P,.001). The risk for TKR increased with probability that a person will undergo TKR from the DL model (odds ratio [OR], 7.7; 95% CI: 2.3, 25; P,.001), KL grade (OR, 1.92; 95% CI: 1.17, 3.13; P =.009), and OARSI grade (OR, 1.20; 95% CI: 0.41, 3.50; P =.73). Conclusion: The proposed deep learning model better predicted risk of total knee replacement in osteoarthritis than did binary outcome models by using standard grading systems.},

   abstract = {The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge is a benchmark in object category classification and detection on hundreds of object categories and millions of images. The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions. This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5 years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements.},

@article{Mujahid2022,
   abstract = {Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in both infants and elderly people, with approximately 4 million deaths each year. It may be a virus, bacterial, or fungal, depending on the contagious pathogen that damages the lung’s tiny air sacs (alveoli). Patients with underlying disorders such as asthma, a weakened immune system, hospitalized babies, and older persons on ventilators are all at risk, particularly if pneumonia is not detected early. Despite the existing approaches for its diagnosis, low accuracy and efficiency require further research for more accurate systems. This study is a similar endeavor for the detection of pneumonia by the use of X-ray images. The dataset is preprocessed to make it suitable for transfer learning tasks. Different pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) variants are utilized, including VGG16, Inception-v3, and ResNet50. Ensembles are made by incorporating CNN with Inception-V3, VGG-16, and ResNet50. Besides the common evaluation metrics, the performance of the pre-trained and ensemble deep learning models is measured with Cohen’s kappa as well as the area under the curve (AUC). Experimental results show that Inception-V3 with CNN attained the highest accuracy and recall score of 99.29% and 99.73%, respectively.},
